================================= JAVA METHOD BONUSES

---- BONUS 1

    Create a class called SentenceAnalyzer.

    Create an application in this class that allows the user to enter a sentence
            and tells them how many vowels and consonants were used.

    Example:

    input - "The hill are alive."
    output - 5 vowels and 10 consonants

    Seperate your logic into various methods, as needed.



---- BONUS 2

    Create a date format converter tool in a class called DateConverter.

    Take in a string in the following format:

    MM/DD/YYYY

    Output the following:

    MonthName DD, YYYY

    Example:

    input - 12/01/1999
    output - December 12, 1999

    Separate your logic into various methods, as needed.

    As an extra challenge, use method overloading to take in an optional boolean second argument that specifies if the date conversion should happen in reverse (e.g. taking in "December 12, 1999" and outputting "12/01/1999").


            ---- BONUS 3

    Create a command line calculator application in a class called CalculatorApp. Use various methods, as needed. s

    The program should welcome the user, prompt them for a calculation,
    and give the result. The user should be prompted after each result is
    outputted if they want to enter another calculation. When they
    say no, give them an exit message. Allow the user first to specify
    how many operands they will enter. Do not worry about
    input validation (assume the user always enters the correct data type).

    Example program (values in {} designate user input are are for example purposes only):

            ...

    WELCOME TO THE CALCULATOR APP!!!

    Do you wish to enter a new calculation? {yes}

    How many operands will you calculate? {2}

    Please enter a calculation: {2 + 2}

    The output of 2 + 2 is 4.

    Do you wish to enter a new calculation? {no}

    GOODBYE!!!
